## Welcome to Module 12: React advanced!

In this module, we are going to dive deeper into React. You can now build basic apps in React, but in this module we are going to go over some more advanced topics, so you will gain a deeper understanding and be able to built more complex features. 

You will learn how to connect your React app to a back-end server and dive deeper into React hooks. State management will be discussed further and Context will be introduced to deal with state variables that are used all over your application. Routing will be introduced to deal with navigation and paths. 

The module will end with a final project to practice and perfect your React skills to the next level. Afterwards, you will also learn how to deploy your apps online and also how to built a portfolio so that you can showcase your projects to potential employees or clients.
